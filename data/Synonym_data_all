7419,""" Dr Mayengbam Lalit Singh Recently honourable PM of India launched scheme call "" "" Doubling Farmers ' Income "" "" in fiat to lift up the social welfare being of larger share of Indians. The big questions felt by people are (i) How would it be possible in shortsighted period of time? And (ii) is it an tough doctrine to swing out vote bank of millions of farmers for approaching parliamentary election in 2019? Across all over India (except for a few states) so many rigidities have to be puzzle out in parliamentary law to arouse the real income of farmers. These rigidities are characterised by infrastructures, structures and institutions. The present clause focuses on those rigidities only for Manipur which has been lag behind many Native american states. Regard infrastructure (inputs ), the state is found back among those backward state of India. Introspecting water infrastructure, the state has been under - utilising water resourcefulness despite the abundant availableness. For Kharif time of year crops farmers rely on rain water since the state is under the map of SE monsoon. However, during Rabi and Zayed seasons the state has been witness scarcity of water. In order of magnitude to curb this shortage, regime needs construction of multiple check dams and digging bore wells in those small streams flowing across the plain areas. During peak season, there is always a shortage of manures and pesticides due to landslide on national highways. Revolution of organic farming will lessen dependency on chemical fertilisers since the state has high potential of producing organic manures and pesticides. During post harvesting menses, the state needs to construct frigid reposition so that perishable crops can be stored for agricultural off season. Regarding financial support to farming, banks are not integrated with farmers. Moreover state government does not organize crop insurance scheme in order to compensate the loss due to natural calamity. My previous article on "" "" Channelizing Mahatma Gandhi Subject Rural Employment Guarantee Human activity (MGNREGA) with Craw and Livestock Insurance in India "" "" postulates the model on how to compensate the loss. The second rigid character of land is that there had been no structural change over tenner. Farming in Manipur focuses on output of only coarse cereals which is characterised by immediate consumption. In this era of globalisation farming should have close introspection of demand and supply model of consumers across the cosmos. Especially in hilly areas, cultivation of coarse cereal is just to meet local consumption and not for earning profits. Present, granger stated cultivation of illegal harvest such as poppy illegally in order to earn huge profit. In order to prevent this, government should emphasise on cultivation cash crops such yongchak (parkia speciosa ), cardamom, tea, coffee, black pepper, etc. since these crop are extremely need in international as comfortably as domestic market. On the other hand this can reduce environmental destruction which is survey after short period zoom cultivation. In plain areas also main crops are likewise common cereals which are vulnerable to low earnings. Farmer should diversify in cultivation of cash crops such as black rice, medicinal plants, oil seed, mushrooms, etc. Moreover farmers should engage themselves in nonfarm sectors wherein both farm and nonfarm sectors can be fitted in supply and demand schedule for their inputs and outputs. One of the institutional rigidities faced by the farmers is asymmetric information on the technological development in farming sphere. Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) had been instituted in every districts across Republic of india in edict to fill the information gap between farmers and farming scientists. However their works had been found confined to laboratory only and their expertise are hardly in the knowledge domain of farmers. Government should redact policies for KVKs so that they should be uncommitted to farmers at least once in a workweek on alternative block. Another institutional rigidness we witness is financial inaccessibility of farmers to existing financial institutions (banks ). In India, banks are found to release funds to manufacturing and serve sectors but not on agricultural sector. Too much functionary procedures and rigid financial securities create inaccessibility of farmers to banks. So the banks should be advised to make survey on the constructive environment wherein farmers should accede and return loan in clock time. Another important institutional rigidity is lack of marketing institutions such as selling farms and agents which can dispense in such agricultural products. Political science should invite both local and nonlocal farms which can link farmers with consumer at price determined by market rate. Government also should have policy such as Minimum Support Mary leontyne price and construction of Cold Storages so that various types of agricultural products can be available during their offseason. The final most important institutional rigidities is inability of government to constitute an integral body which comprises above mentioned farmers body, financial institute, KVKs, Marketing farms and government fund research institute. If the integral body function with mutual exchange of workings with all institutional constituents, ambition of "" "" Doubling Farmers ' Income "" "" can be achieved.
