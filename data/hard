UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency. Despite these dangers, the number of migrants crossing the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea into Yemen has risen steadily, from 92,000 in 2015 to 117,000 in 2016, according to UNHCR. Khaled al-Elwany, a local official who until recently oversaw the deportation of migrants to their home countries, says up to 15,000 migrants are stopped at checkpoints around the city every month. Elwany says he was fired by the Home Office for refusing to cooperate on a plan to move the center to a neighboring province and after authorities cut off food supplies. A ministry official told Reuters the purpose of the move to a new facility is to improve conditions for migrants while they await deportation. Saudi Arabia and a coalition of mostly Gulf Arab allies are fighting to reinstate Yemen's government-in-exile and roll back the Iran-allied Houthi movement. While the government nominally controls Aden and other southern regions, a budget crisis and rivalries with local armed groups mean its officials are largely based overseas. Government services and salaries have been hit hard by the chaos, and African migrants appear to be a lower priority. The terrified men in Aden's warehouse, living off bread they bought with meager savings and washing their clothes in a garbage-strewn outdoor plaza, are just the tip of the iceberg.""","[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]"
